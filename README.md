Hello!

This repository contains my notes on how to setup the Asus TinkerBoard (Raspberry Pi alternative). 

There is very little official information published on using the TinkerBoard. This can be frustrating. The TinkerBoard runs an operating system published by Asus called TinkerOS and the board itself uses and ARM-based processor. The TinkerBoard DOES NOT run the Raspberry Pi operating system called Raspbian. Much of the how to information you find for the Raspberry Pi does not work on the TinkerBoard. Instead you are better off refering to official documentaion for Linux Debian and just pretent the TinkerBoard as a mini desktop computer.

Whenever possible, use the standard built-in Linux Debian command line functionality to achieve taksks rather than trying to find a desktop application that runs on the TinkerBoard's ARM-based processor. Very often the built-in functions work better than 3rd party apps anyway and are easier to script in Python, etc.
