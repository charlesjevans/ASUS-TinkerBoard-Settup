# Download TinkerOS to a computer that has a micro sd card reader
# Use version linaro-stretch-alip-v2.0.7.zip [1037MB] or newer
# https://tinkerboarding.co.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Software#TinkerOS
# Do not use the version distributed by the USA Asus TinkerBoard website!

# Prepare a Bootable SD Card
# Download and install the disk imaging utility Etcher: https://etcher.io/
# Put a micro sd card into your card reader (32G)
# Launch Etcher
   # Select the TinkerOS disk image that you downloaded
   # Select the target drive (the micro sd card you that you inserted)
   # Select the “Flash!” button in Etcher to begin writing the disk image (takes about 5 minutes)
   # Remove card when finished.


# First Time Boot Up
# Insert micro sd card into the Tinker Board memory slot.
# Connect hdmi display, keyboard, mouse, ethernet
# Connect power to the Tinker Board 
# Eventually the TinkerOS desktop will appear on the HDMI display.

# Boot Up Problems
# If the usb power supply is too low the board might shut down suddenly.
# If the power stays on but nothing happens it means the sd card is not readable.
# Download the TinkerOS disk image again, verify the name and version.

#### Troubleshoot Display
# If the TinkerBoard is connected to a TV (ex: LG WebOS TV) the desktop might get cut off around the edges. 
In the TV’s settings disable overscan.
